**QA Automation Engineering Case Study**
API + UI + Mobile Integration Testing for a Multi-Tenant B2B SaaS Platform

**Overview**
This repository contains my solution to a QA Automation Engineering case study focused on testing a multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform (“WorkFlow Pro”).
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate testing strategy, framework design thinking, and integration test logic, rather than delivering a fully runnable production framework.

**The solution covers:**
Debugging flaky UI automation tests
Designing a scalable test automation framework
Implementing an API + UI + Mobile integration test
Handling multi-tenant isolation and cross-platform validation
Considering real-world CI/CD constraints

**Tech Stack**
Python
pytest – test orchestration
Playwright – web UI automation
requests – API testing
BrowserStack – cross-browser and mobile testing (conceptual integration)
CI/CD-friendly design – headless execution, parallel-ready
Note: Some integrations (e.g., BrowserStack execution, authentication tokens) are represented conceptually or via pseudocode, as this is a design-focused assessment.
